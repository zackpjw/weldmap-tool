# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## metadata:
##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

# Interactive Weld Mapping Tool - Test Results

## Current Status: ✅ ENHANCED - Line Drawing System Implemented

### Major Feature Update: Click-and-Drag Line Drawing System

**New Functionality**:
1. ✅ **Click-and-Drag Interface**: Users click and drag to draw lines from start to end point
2. ✅ **Symbol at Line End**: Weld symbol automatically appears at the end of each drawn line
3. ✅ **Real-time Preview**: Dashed line and preview symbol shown while dragging
4. ✅ **Connected Annotations**: Each annotation consists of both a line and a symbol

**Previous Issues Fixed**:
1. ✅ **Shape Outlines**: All symbols now have colored outlines (no fill)
2. ✅ **20% Larger Symbols**: Increased size from 24px to 29px for better visibility
3. ✅ **Export Button Always Visible**: Now shows when PDF is loaded (not just when symbols exist)
4. ✅ **Click Detection Fixed**: Proper logic for selecting existing annotations

### New Interaction Model:
- **Select Symbol Type**: Choose from 5 weld symbol types in palette
- **Draw Line**: Click and drag on PDF to draw annotation line
- **Symbol Placement**: Weld symbol automatically placed at line end
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time preview with dashed line during drawing
- **Selection**: Click existing annotations to select them
- **Removal**: Remove mode or Delete/Backspace key to remove annotations

### Technical Implementation:
- ✅ **SVG Line Rendering**: Lines drawn with SVG for crisp display at all zoom levels
- ✅ **Dual Data Structure**: Supports both old format (x,y) and new format (lineStart, lineEnd, symbolPosition)
- ✅ **Zoom Integration**: Lines and symbols scale properly with zoom level
- ✅ **Preview System**: Live preview during drawing with dashed lines
- ✅ **Enhanced UI**: Updated terminology from "symbols" to "annotations"

### Backend API Endpoints (Working):
- ✅ `GET /api/health` - Health check
- ✅ `POST /api/upload-pdf-only` - PDF upload and conversion
- ✅ `POST /api/export-pdf` - Export annotated PDF
- ✅ `POST /api/export-annotations` - Export annotations data

### Current System Status:
- ✅ **Backend**: Running on port 8001 (healthy)
- ✅ **Frontend**: Running on port 3000 (compiled successfully)
- ✅ **MongoDB**: Running and accessible
- ✅ **API Connection**: Frontend correctly configured with backend URL

### Features Implemented & Working:
1. ✅ **Line Drawing System**: Click-drag interface for creating line annotations
2. ✅ **Symbol Outlines**: Colored outlines, 20% larger, better visibility
3. ✅ **Real-time Preview**: Dashed line preview while drawing
4. ✅ **Independent Zoom/Scroll**: Zoom only works when mouse is over PDF area
5. ✅ **Optimized Layout**: 50px navbar, expanded workspace, proper component arrangement
6. ✅ **Export Functionality**: Always available when PDF is loaded
7. ✅ **Project Management**: Save/load functionality with new annotation format
8. ✅ **Enhanced UI**: Updated instructions and feedback for line drawing workflow

### Test Status: ✅ PRODUCTION READY - Perfect Export System + Enhanced Shapes
The Interactive Weld Mapping Tool now features:
- ✅ **Perfect Export Match**: Exported PDFs now identically match the PDF editor display
- ✅ **Precise Coordinate Mapping**: Click positions match line start positions exactly
- ✅ **Smart Line Connection**: Lines connect to appropriate sides of shapes based on direction
- ✅ **Enhanced Hexagon**: 10% larger with horizontal line inside, better line connection
- ✅ **Optimized Rectangles**: 40% wider, 50% height for better proportions
- ✅ **Professional SVG Shapes**: Single-border, properly sized shapes with specifications:
  - All shapes 20% larger than previous version (35px base size)
  - Blue rectangle (pipe_section): 40% wider, 50% height, 10px rounded corners
  - Red rectangle (pipe_support): 40% wider, 50% height, sharp corners
  - Hexagon (flange_joint): 10% larger with horizontal line inside
  - Diamond, circle: Properly proportioned with single border lines
- ✅ **Enhanced Visual Quality**: No double borders, crisp SVG rendering at all zoom levels
- ✅ **Real-time Preview**: Live feedback with proper shape previews during drawing
- ✅ **Identical Export**: Backend export system matches frontend display exactly with lines and symbols

**Export Features:**
- ✅ Line drawing export (draws both lines and symbols)
- ✅ Proper coordinate transformation 
- ✅ Matching shape specifications between frontend and export
- ✅ Support for both old and new annotation formats
- ✅ High-quality PDF output with exact positioning

The application now provides industrial-grade welding annotation capabilities with perfect export functionality that matches professional engineering documentation standards.
