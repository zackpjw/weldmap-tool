# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## metadata:
##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

# Interactive Weld Mapping Tool - Test Results

## Current Status: âœ… ENHANCED - Line Drawing System Implemented

### Major Feature Update: Click-and-Drag Line Drawing System

**New Functionality**:
1. âœ… **Click-and-Drag Interface**: Users click and drag to draw lines from start to end point
2. âœ… **Symbol at Line End**: Weld symbol automatically appears at the end of each drawn line
3. âœ… **Real-time Preview**: Dashed line and preview symbol shown while dragging
4. âœ… **Connected Annotations**: Each annotation consists of both a line and a symbol

**Previous Issues Fixed**:
1. âœ… **Shape Outlines**: All symbols now have colored outlines (no fill)
2. âœ… **20% Larger Symbols**: Increased size from 24px to 29px for better visibility
3. âœ… **Export Button Always Visible**: Now shows when PDF is loaded (not just when symbols exist)
4. âœ… **Click Detection Fixed**: Proper logic for selecting existing annotations

### New Interaction Model:
- **Select Symbol Type**: Choose from 5 weld symbol types in palette
- **Draw Line**: Click and drag on PDF to draw annotation line
- **Symbol Placement**: Weld symbol automatically placed at line end
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time preview with dashed line during drawing
- **Selection**: Click existing annotations to select them
- **Removal**: Remove mode or Delete/Backspace key to remove annotations

### Technical Implementation:
- âœ… **SVG Line Rendering**: Lines drawn with SVG for crisp display at all zoom levels

- âœ… **Color Accuracy**: Exact color matching between editor and export
- âœ… **Position Accuracy**: Every annotation appears in exact same location
- âœ… **Multi-page Support**: Perfect handling of multi-page PDFs

**Export Data Structure:**
```javascript
exportData = {
  symbols: [...], // Complete annotation data
  images: [...], // PDF page images
  canvasInfo: {
    elementWidth, elementHeight, // Real canvas dimensions
    displayedWidth, displayedHeight, // Display size
    currentZoom, currentPan, // View state
    devicePixelRatio // Display context
  },
  shapeSpecs: {
    baseSize, uniformSize, // Size specifications
    diamond, circle, blueRect, redRect, hexagon // Shape-specific properties
  }
}
```

The exported PDF now perfectly matches the PDF editor with exact positioning, zero gaps between lines and shapes, and complete shape retention.
